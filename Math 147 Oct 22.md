## Definition

A function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is bounded on $$ if $\exists M \in \mathbb{R}$ s.t. $|f(x)|\leq M$ $\forall x \in S$. 

For example, because $|\sin(x)|\leq 1$ $\forall x$, we know that $f(x)=\sin(x)$ is bounded.

## Definition

Let $S \subseteq dom(f)$. The maximum of $f$ on $S$ is $\max(f(s))$ and the minimum of $f$ on $S$ is $\min(f(s))$. 

## Definition

A set $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is compact if $K$ is closed and bounded.

# Extreme Value Theorem

Let $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function. Let $C \subseteq dom(f)$ be nonempty and compact. Then $f(C)$ is compact so $f$ is bounded on $C$. Also, $f$ will attain a aximum and a minimum on $C$. 

## Theorem

Let $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be nonempty and bounded above so $\sup(X)$ exists. Then there exists a sequence of elements in $X$ converging to $\sup(X)$. 

## Theorem

Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then $M$ is the maximum of $A$ iff $M = \sup(A)$ and $M \in A$.
